3. Check Permissions & Reviews
   Look at the permissions each extension requests (e.g., access to browsing history, tabs, data).
   Check reviews and ratings from trusted sources or the browser’s store.

4. Identify Suspicious/Unused Extensions
   Flag extensions you don’t recognize, rarely use, or that have excessive permissions.

5. Remove Unnecessary or Malicious Extensions
   Uninstall or disable suspicious/unneeded ones.

   Steal personal data and passwords.
   Track browsing activity.
   Inject ads or redirect traffic.
   Install malware or crypto miners.

   Keep a record for security auditing or reporting.
